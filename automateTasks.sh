<<USAGE
**Purpose**
Perform backup tasks that you wish to occur daily and/or weekly. The idea is to create duplicates of important data in order to avoid accidentally deleting important local documents.
You can also add your own custom tasks to be run cyclically. If an internet connection is required for your particular task, there is code to verify this below.
You could of course accomplish much of this with crontab, but I wanted to try something new.

**How to**
1) Move this script to your $HOME directory, and add the following to your .bash_profile so that the script runs everytime you open the terminal.
	if [ -r automateTasks.sh ]
	then
		./automateTasks.sh
	fi
2) Execute the following:
	chmod ug+x automateTasks.sh
3) To add the tasks that you would like to perform, head to the "HowTo" comment near the end of the script. There, you can specify the tasks.
4) I'd suggest not editting any other part of the script, (though you have free will). Note the "DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION UNTIL..." labels.

**Other**
This script makes use of the .dateTracker.txt file to determine if a new round of backups needs to be performed. It tracks the date since the terminal was last opened. If the file is deleted, this script will create a new one.

<<HowTo
• Below is where you can specify the files or directories that you would like to backup, and their backup location. 
• Follow the simple samples given for calling the backup functions.
• Remember to remove the comment lines around your function call for your backup to actually run.
• Both the file being backed up and the backup directory need to exist prior to running the script.
